# CySpace

CySpace is a next-generation social media platform that redefines online interactions by prioritizing meaningful connections over superficial engagement metrics.

## üåü The Problem We Solve

Modern social media platforms encourage superficial interactions‚Äîusers mindlessly like, comment, and move on without forming meaningful connections. Additionally, onboarding new users to Web3 is a complex and intimidating process, filled with technical jargon and barriers like wallet management and gas fees, which discourage mainstream adoption.

## üöÄ Our Solution

CySpace addresses these challenges by:

- **Incentivizing deeper social connections** ‚Äî users are rewarded based on how well they truly know their friends, fostering more meaningful engagement
- **Seamlessly onboarding Web2 users into Web3** using an embedded wallet linked with Google Sign-in paired with gas sponsored account abstraction
- **Providing a familiar and engaging social media experience** with broad appeal, making Web3 adoption smoother and more intuitive

## üîÑ User Interaction and Data Flow

### Onboarding & Profile Setup
- Sign up using Google account for seamless authentication
- Choose a username and write a short bio including hobbies, personality traits, and interests
- Optional to connect to Twitter to allow AI agents to learn about you through your tweets, tweets are verified onchain using Flare FDC

### Social Media Interface
- View posts from friends and interact with content in the main feed
- Create two types of posts:
  - Pictures (standard social media posts)
  - Diaries (blog-like entries)
- All posts are stored on the blockchain for transparency and ownership

### Personal Homespace
- Enter your 3D Homespace, a virtual personal space where you can:
  - Update pictures and diaries
  - Customize your environment

### Visiting Another User's Homespace
When visiting a friend's Homespace, you'll find:
- **Whiteboard** ‚Äì Draw on it and have your interactions stored on the blockchain as proof of visit
- **Bookshelf** ‚Äì Browse your friend's diaries and written content
- **3D Model of the User** ‚Äì Interact with an AI-driven avatar trained on the owner's personality:
  - Take quizzes to demonstrate how well you know them
  - Earn Soulbound NFTs and tokens as rewards for being a good friend

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture and Development

### Core Components:

#### User Onboarding
- Leverages **Okto** for streamlined authentication with Google accounts
- Removes complexity of handling wallets and private keys

#### Social Media and Content Storage
- Content stored in a decentralized manner using **EthStorage** and **Walrus**
- Ensures data permanence and ownership

#### On-Chain Infrastructure
- Operates on the **Base blockchain** for low-cost, scalable transactions
- Securely records interactions like visit proofs, content, and AI engagements on-chain

### Development Stack:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Supabase for off-chain user data, The Graph for indexing on-chain content

## üîå Product Integrations

### User Authentication & Wallet Management
- **Google Auth** ‚Äì Frictionless user login
- **Okto** ‚Äì Wallet abstraction without private key management

### Content Storage & Blockchain Integration
- **EthStorage** ‚Äì Decentralized storage for user-generated content
- **Walrus** ‚Äì Auto-deletion based on epochs for temporary homespace whiteboards
- **Base** ‚Äì Layer 2 blockchain for low-cost, scalable transactions

### AI-Driven Social Experience
- **Coinbase SDK AgentKit** ‚Äì Powers AI-driven 3D avatars with minting capabilities
- **Flare FDC** ‚Äì Verifies tweets onchain, tweets are used to train the AI avatar (due to X API rate limits and cost, api responses are hard-coded for now)

## üåà Key Differentiators

### Meaningful Social Connections Through Rewards

## üõ†Ô∏è Trade-offs and Future Improvements

### Current Trade-offs
- Prioritized seamless onboarding over wallet flexibility
- Limited options for representing "good connections"

### Future Enhancements
- Support for direct wallet connections for crypto-native users
- Customizable profile badges or NFT-based friendship tokens
- Token drops or exclusive rewards for long-term meaningful interactions
- More media sources to train the AI avatar
