# CySpace

CySpace is a next-generation social media platform that redefines online interactions by prioritizing meaningful connections over superficial engagement metrics.

## üåü The Problem We Solve

Modern social media platforms encourage superficial interactions‚Äîusers mindlessly like, comment, and move on without forming meaningful connections. Additionally, onboarding new users to Web3 is a complex and intimidating process, filled with technical jargon and barriers like wallet management and gas fees, which discourage mainstream adoption.

## üöÄ Our Solution

CySpace addresses these challenges by:

- **Incentivizing deeper social connections** ‚Äî users are rewarded based on how well they truly know their friends, fostering more meaningful engagement
- **Seamlessly onboarding Web2 users into Web3** using an embedded wallet linked with Google Sign-in paired with gas sponsored account abstraction
- **Providing a familiar and engaging social media experience** with broad appeal, making Web3 adoption smoother and more intuitive

## üîÑ User Interaction and Data Flow

### Onboarding & Profile Setup
- Sign up using Google account for seamless authentication
- Choose a username and write a short bio including hobbies, personality traits, and interests
- Optional to connect to Twitter to allow AI agents to learn about you through your tweets, tweets are verified onchain using Flare FDC

### Social Media Interface
- View posts from friends and interact with content in the main feed
- Create two types of posts:
  - Pictures (standard social media posts)
  - Diaries (blog-like entries)
- All posts are stored on the blockchain for transparency and ownership

### Personal Homespace

  - Update pictures and diaries
  - Customize your environment

### Visiting Another User's Homespace
When visiting a friend's Homespace, you'll find:
- **Whiteboard** ‚Äì Draw on it and have your interactions stored on the blockchain as proof of visit
- **Bookshelf** ‚Äì Browse your friend's diaries and written content
- **3D Model of the User** ‚Äì Interact with an AI-driven avatar trained on the owner's personality:
  - Take quizzes to demonstrate how well you know them
  - Earn Soulbound NFTs and tokens as rewards for being a good friend
